# Plotly-
Belly Button Biodiversity Project 
Module 12 

Overview:

This project was designed to provide a data dashboard displaying several chart types based on user selected input. Using a simple index page (html and bootstrap) to display the charts, JavaScript powers the event handlers, user input, and chart creation.

Resources:

index.html: html, css, js, bootstrap, d3
style.css: image of bacteria
data.js: json data (provided)
charts.js: d3, plotly

Results:

The index page is simple and clean, thanks to Bootstrap's grid system. The event handlers (d3) make selecting the sample from the dropdown box easy and highly responsive. Plotly allows for the creation of the three charts in a straightforward fashion with minimal coding.

The horizontal bar chart caused the most challenge, though not much, in requiring the labels to be reversed so that the bacteria were presented in descending order - needing to reverse both the data and the labels.

The gauge chart is, at this point, a fancy way of presenting a single data point. Such a chart could present more information, but it currently displays more chrome than data.

The bubble chart can be very useful. At the moment, the data presented is not particularly salient for the viewer. What is being presented is not entirely clear and the viewer needs to decipher what information is being presented. As this project is primarily about the process of creating the charts, this is acceptable. If, however, this was for an actual presentation of information, a lot of thought would need to go into making this chart more useful for its audience.

Summary:

This project expands significantly on the previous project and requires an added degree of effort and sophistication in the presentation of the material. Given that each of these projects must be completed within one week, this was a significant and appropriate increase in difficulty. This continues to lay the groundwork for a complete and robust presentation of data.

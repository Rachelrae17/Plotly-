# Plotly-
Belly Button Biodiversity Project 
Module 12 

Results: 
Plotly platform tools helps to create all three of the charts in which were learned and taught in this module. The cool concept about plotly 
is that you can make and create these charts images without using intense coding which I thought was helpful and understanding of the concepts. 

Deliverable 1 - Was the task of creating a Horizontal chart. This was made to show the bacteria in a descending order and display the data in this form. 

Deliverable 2- Was the task of creating a Bubble Chart was my favorite because I thought it was more fun to create abd more intresting to display and look at and read 
from a chart form. 

Deliverable 3- Was thr task of creating a Gauge Chart is a powerful way of presenting a small amount of data into a chart form. 

Summary: 
This project was meant to be able to show the data in different models of charts and that you learn how to create them and read and understand the 
data that is presented in the chart that you would be able to grasp the concept and than be able to make a conclusion based off that charts data.
